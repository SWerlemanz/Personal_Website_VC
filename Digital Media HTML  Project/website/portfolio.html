<h1> Portfolio</h1>

<p> These are the projects from my first semester digital media class. I learned about image editing, video editing, animation, and web design. </p>

<br>
<h3>Photoshop Project</h3>

<p> <h4>Aliens are abducting animals? <img src="media/cat.png" height="50" width="50">  <br> Why? For what purpose? I'm afraid we may never find out... </h4> My Photoshop Project taught me about layer masks, adjustment layers, and blending modes.<br> I wanted to use an alien invasion as my theme, but also wanted to have cat somewhere, thus I mixed both ideas together. </p>

<br>

<h3>Stop Motion Project</h3>

<p> <h4> Maybe not all foxes are mischievous... <img src="media/Fox.png" height="25" width="25"> <br>Maybe not all heroes wear capes...</h4>
This is my stop motion animation where I learned to animate and use a 30 fps frame rate. <br> I wanted to tell a short story using stop motion. I took the photos that I needed, then went to work on editing them.<br>I also wanted to use a green screen for this project, but that ended up taking most of my time in this project, <br>as I manually removed the background in every image. </p>

<br>

<h3> Video Editing</h3>

<p> <h4> How far will you go to win? </h4> This is my video project where I learned how to shoot, cut and edit video footage. <br> My idea was for this video, <br> was to trick people into thinking that it's one thing, <br> but it turns out to be something completely different.  </p>
